The `master` branch hosts iXMaps 0.9. Version 0.9 is a release candidate for the iXMaps thematic mapping framework.

**iXMaps** is a vector graphic mapping framework, based on **SVG files** generated by an iXMaps tool, and a **JavaScript library** to geographically handle these SVG files.

The iXmaps vector layer is usually displayed on top of a HTML Tile Map powered by Leaflet.

iXMaps provides a **high-level** **visualization grammar** for thematic maps. It defines a concise **JSON syntax** for supporting rapid generation of visualizations from raw data.

You can find more details here:  [theme grammar (JSON)](http://public.ixmaps.com/docs/ixmaps_doc_themes.html), [theme api (JavaScript)](http://public.ixmaps.com/docs/jsdocs/out/index.html), [iXMaps page](http://iXMaps.com/), [examples](http://testrc.ixmaps.com.s3-website.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/ixmaps/index/index.html) and GIST [tutorial](http://public.ixmaps.com/docs/gist/ixmaps_gist_viewer.html#3aff1217ef8070b55b1755da4e29ce5f).
